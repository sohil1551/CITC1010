            <h2>Save the Tigers</h2>

            <p>
                Tigers are one of the most beautiful and powerful animals in the world, but today they are endangered.
                Their population has decreased because of deforestation, illegal hunting, and loss of habitat.
                If we do not protect tigers now, they could disappear forever.
            </p>

                Tigers are very important to nature. They help keep the ecosystem balanced by controlling the population
                of other animals. When tigers are safe, forests stay healthy and many other species are protected too.

                <p>
                   Tigers are large, muscular cats with a long tail, large paws, and a broad head. Their fur is typically reddish-orange with black vertical stripes, and no two tigers have the same pattern, making each individual unique. Adult males weigh between 100–300 kg (220–660 lbs), while females are smaller, weighing 75–180 kg (165–400 lbs),. Tigers can reach lengths of 1.5–4 meters (5–13 feet) from nose to tail, with the Amur tiger being the largest subspecies. Their claws are retractable, and their teeth can measure up to 4 inches long.

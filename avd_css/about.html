                <h2>characteristics of tigers</h2>
                <p>
                   Tigers are large, muscular cats with a long tail, large paws, and a broad head. Their fur is typically reddish-orange with black vertical stripes, and no two tigers have the same pattern, making each individual unique. Adult males weigh between 100–300 kg (220–660 lbs), while females are smaller, weighing 75–180 kg (165–400 lbs),. Tigers can reach lengths of 1.5–4 meters (5–13 feet) from nose to tail, with the Amur tiger being the largest subspecies. Their claws are retractable, and their teeth can measure up to 4 inches long.

                    Habitat and Range
                    Tigers are native to Asia and inhabit a variety of environments, including tropical and subtropical forests, grasslands, swamps, and the Siberian taiga. Historically, they ranged across much of Eastern, Southern, and parts of Central and Western Asia, but today they occupy only about 7% of their historic range. Subspecies include the Bengal, Siberian (Amur), Sumatran, Indo-Chinese, South China, and Malayan tigers

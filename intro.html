  <p>
     Saving the environment might seem like a tall order, but living an environmentally friendly life is actually quite easy. <br>With just a few small lifestyle changes, you can protect the planet while creating a healthier life for yourself and future generations. <br> A single household or individual can make a big difference: the more people become environmentally conscious, the healthier our planet will be.

    <li>reduce</li>
    Reduce means cutting down on the amount of waste we create. This can be done by using less electricity and water, avoiding disposable items, and choosing products with less packaging. <br>When we reduce waste, fewer natural resources are used, and less pollution is created, helping protect the environment.
    <br>
    <br>   
    <li>reuse</li>
    Reuse means finding new ways to use items instead of throwing them away. For example, people can reuse shopping bags, refill water bottles, or repurpose jars and containers. Reusing items helps save energy and resources because fewer new products need to be made.
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>recycle</li>
    Recycle means processing used materials to create new products. Materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal can often be recycled instead of sent to landfills. Recycling helps conserve natural resources, reduces pollution, and saves energy during manufacturing.
